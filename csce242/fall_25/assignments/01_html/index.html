        <h1>MUSIC</h1>
        <p>Music comes in all different packages. Some is worse than others. An example of really bad music is Tom MacDonald . But there is also great music, like Gerard Way from My Chemical Romance</p>
        <p>There are also a ton of different genres. One genre is Rap and another is Rock. Right now I really like Rap. In the past I really liked metal but if come off it a little.</p>
