        <p>
            I have two cats at my house. 
            One of them is named Pheobe and the other is named Mace.
            Pheobe is a grey and white cat.
            Mace is a black, brown, and a little white

            Cats are also better than dogs.
            Cats take care of themselves pretty much.
            Cats don't bother you to take them on a walk (I like this because I am lazy).
            Cats can sit comfortably on you unlike most dogs.
